# Brain-Tumour-Identification-Using-CNN

#Brain tumor is a collection of abnormal cells in our brain. Tumor detection is one 
of the most important fields in medical science because brain tumor affects the 
normal functioning of the human body. Medical imaging technique plays a 
crucial role in identifying the tumor cells. With the help of CT scan and MRI 
imaging technique, the images of the brain can be obtained. This project is also 
conveyed us by knowing, artificial intelligence is helpful in solving real life 
problems. This project gives us the way to find the Brain Tumor by using CNN 
algorithm and another some classification algorithms and methods. Detection of 
Brain Tumor through some automatic technique is beneficial as it requires a large 
amount of work of monitoring by doctors, and at very early stage itself it detects 
symptoms of diseases means we can cure easily. In order to detect the Tumor 
some steps are to be followed using image processing. Detection of Brain Tumor
will help to. This also makes the development of artificial intelligence technology 
in solving real life problems in model of machine level. The Algorithms we are 
using here are transfer learning algorithms like VGG19 and MobileNet Model 
and also a model CNN Model which we have built. To identify the brain tumor,
scanned MRI images are given as the input and we will be knowing whether 
tumor exists or not in the MRI Image. We have also built a website whether the 
user gives a image then he can able to know whether the tumor exists or not.
